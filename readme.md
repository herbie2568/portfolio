PROJECT 1 

Technologies used: 
Pretty much all of my site was written with jQuery and CSS. I used Netlify to deploy my page.

Approach taken: 
I made a single page site, with the nav bar scrolling to different sections of the website. I wanted to make the design of the website to have a sleek, modern look and not too many distractions. I used 3 different media queries for optimal viewing styles based on screen size.

Unsolved problems: 
For some reason, my website looks different when going from the dev tools in my browser to viewing it on my actual phone. If I tried to fix something on one, it would mess it up on the other. This was frustrating, so I just went off how it looks in the browser, because I would have to keep committing it to be able to see the changes on my phone. Also, the left arrow on my carousel comes up upside down for some reason when I look at it on my phone and I don't know why. 

Other thoughts: 
1. I really wanted to finish the Zelda-themed game (in Projects page) that I was working on but unfortunately had no time.
2. I feel like my website is kinda plain, and I tried to add background images to give it a little more life but it just didn't look good, so I left it black. I just wish I was better at the actual design of websites. 
3. The CSS file fills up very fast, more time was spent looking for the right selector to do stuff for.
